# The C Standard Library - 2ED
P.J. Plauger (1992)

## Introduction

It corrects a number of errors reported after publication. Hence, the code 
may differ from the book in small ways. In general, the header files in the 
directory of "_headers" are updted. The rest of them comply with the original
book. 

## Contents

Fifteen subdirectories match the standard headers. These contain all the *.c 
files presented in the text. The directory _test contains all the t*.c files 
presented as test programs throughout the text. All of the code are converted 
to the indentation of spaces. It has the directories including _unixvax for 
the ULTRIX, _unix68k for Sun UNIX (680X0) and _tc86 for Turbo C++ compiler.

## Examples

Some of the subdirectories including the file of float including the practical 
examples such as enquires.c and paranoia.c. Each of programs has more than 1000
lines of code. It is quite useful for a further learning and understanding of C 
languages.
