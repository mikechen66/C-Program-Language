# The C Standard Library - 2ED
P.J. Plauger (1992)

## Introduction

It corrects a number of errors reported after release. Hence, the code may 
differ from the original code in small ways. In general, the header files in 
the directory of "_headers" are updated. The rest of them comply with the 
original book. 

## Contents

Fifteen sub-directories match the standard headers. These contain all the *.c 
files presented in the text. The directory _test contains all the t*.c files 
presented as test programs throughout the text. All of the code are converted 
to the indentation of spaces. It has the directories including _unixvax for 
the ULTRIX (DEC), _unix68k for Sun UNIX (680X0) and _tc86 for Turbo C++ compiler
(or ANSI C).

## Examples

Some of the sub-directories including the file of float including the practical 
examples such as enquire.c and paranoia.c. Each of programs has more than 1000
lines of code. It is quite useful for a further learning and understanding of C 
languages.
