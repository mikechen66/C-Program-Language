UNIX V6 Source Code with  Lions' Commentary
Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, John Lions

## Prologue 

For Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie: ars longa vita brevis (Greek). Ken and Dennis created the souce code and John had a perfect commentary on the 6th version, lightly edited by Lions to better sererte the functionality system initialization and process management, interrupts and system calls, basic I/O, file systems and pipes and character devices. The classical source code has built the foundation of the operating systems including Mach, BSD, Linux, MacOS and Windows.  

## Interlude

Unix 6th Edition was released as a distribution including the full source code. Since the source code was available, V6 was taken up as a teaching tool, notably by the University of California, Berkeley and the University of New South Wales (UNSW). UC Berkeley distributed a set of add-on programs called the First Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), which later became a complete operating system distribution. Since the code only inlcude 9000 + lines of code, it is the perfect material for developers to learn both C and the operating system. 

## Epilogue

Ars longa, vita brevis is a Latin translation of an aphorism coming originally from Greek, roughly meaning, "skilfulness takes time and life is short". Any programmer who wants to know C needs to understand how it created and constructed to build the Unix Operting System. That is the motto for every programmer.
