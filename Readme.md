# C Programming 

## Introduction

C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system on the DEC PDP-11, by Dennis Ritchie. The operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs. C is not tied to any particular hardware or system, however, and it is easy to write programs that will run without change on any machine that supports C. The C language evolves from the orginal K&N C to the modern ASNI C. 

## Power of C Language

C gives programmers more control over where data is stored and how it is initialized than many languages do. C's lack of "safety net" features also contributes to its efficiency, but increases the likelihood of errors. For example, subscripts to arrays and accesses through pointers are not checked for validity, which saves time but makes it much more important that these features be used correctly. If the language is used with discipline, the potential problems can be avoided. 

## Benefits of C Lanuage 

1.The rich collection of operators provided in C give the programmer power to efficiently perform low-level computations, such as shifting and masking, without resorting to assembly language. These characteristics make C a good choice for implementing operating systems and low-level software for embedded controllers.

2.Another reason for its popularity is its ubiquity. C compilers are widely available for a great number of machines. In addition, the ANSI Standard improves the portability of C programs among different machines.

3.C is the foundation upon which C++ is built. C++ provides a different view of program design and implementation than C. Nevertheless, a thorough knowledge of C skills and techniques, such as using pointers and the standard library, will also be useful for the C++ programmer.
