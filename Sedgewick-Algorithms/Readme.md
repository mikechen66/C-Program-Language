# Algorithms in C
Robert Sedgewick

## Introduction

This volume covers fundamental concepts, data structures, sorting algorithms, and searching 
algorithms; the second volume covers advanced algorithms and applications, building on the
basic abstractions andmethods developed here. Nearly all thematerial on fundamentals and data 
structures in this edition is new. The basic methods described here have become essential in 
scientific research; and from database systems to Internet search engines, they have become
essential parts of modern software systems.

## Algorithms of Practical Use

The orientation is to study algorithms likely to be of practical use. It provides information 
about the tools of the trade to the point that readers can confidently implement, debug, and 
put to work algorithms to solve a problem or to provide functionality in an application. Full 
implementations of the methods discussed are included, as are descriptions  of the operations 
of these programs on a consistent set of examples. Because we work with real  code rather than 
write pseudo-code, the programs' { and } symbokl has double indent in the webpage but can be 
put to practical us  quickly. Please see the following weblink for reference. 

## Additional Benefit

The books have the versions of C, C++ and Java. So all of the codes can be cross-referenced
for multiple programming learning since it is common with multiple languages to design and 
implement user-oriented applications in the practical world.
