# Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)
Thomas Cormen et al

## Introduction

Introduction to Algorithms (shortly CLRS) provides a comprehensive introduction 
to the modern study of computer algorithms. It presents many algorithms and 
covers them in considerable depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible
to all levels of readers. We have tried to keep explanations elementary without 
sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.

## Content

CLRS , as a corner stone, is a comprehensive textbook covering the full spectrum
of modern algorithms: from the fastest algorithms and data structures to polynomial
-time algorithms for seemingly intractable problems, from classical algorithms in 
graph theory to special algorithms for string matching, computational geometry, and 
number theory. The revised third edition notably adds a chapter on van Emde Boas 
trees, one of the most useful data structures, and on multithreaded algorithms, a 
topic of increasing importance.

## Source

According to the first author, The McGraw-Hill version of the 2nd edition came with 
a CD containing Java implementations. These are the only available implementations 
that have been approved by the authors. When the fourth edition is released, there 
will also be Python implementations available. For other pubished source code not 
made by the authors such as C and C++, please take them just as reference.
